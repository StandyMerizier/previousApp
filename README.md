Beers & Comments

This project was made so individual can comments on their beer of choice and share.


How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js

In this project, we wanted to create a space where people can come and share their thoughts on specific beers, users can thumbs up or thumbs down comments as well as delete comments.

Optimizations
Still need better styling.

Lesson Learned:
Will come later when changes are made.
